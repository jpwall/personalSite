	<p id="mainText">
	  This program is currently unfinished and in progress. In the future, the main goal of this program is to be able to play the card game called oh hell. This card game is similar to hearts and is a combination of luck and strategy. More can be read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell">here</a>.

	<div id="projectTitlePurple">Blog</div>
	<p id="mainText">
	  In the future I plan to create a blog where I talk about all the things that have been going on with my endeavors in technology, design, robotics, and art. This blog would be based on a blogging engine that a friend of mine is currently making. I plan to have him explain it to me and then use it myself if I see fit. When I do have a blog up, this project will be marked as in progress and there will be a ‘Blog’ button in the header of this site.

	<p id="mainText">
	  One of my hobbies outside of computers and such are portraits. I do them when I am feeling artistic late at night or when requested. For me they are quite a fun and calming activity to indulge in. Feel free to request one by going to the contact page and shooting me an email or texting me. You can also take a look at all the portraits I have done by clicking on the link to them above.

	<a href="https://github.com/jpwall/stock"><div id="projectTitleRed">Stock</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  Stock is a current project that I am working on which is intended to be a go-to program that does everything stock related. Currently it’s capabilities include calculating the profit of a buy/sell stock trade. This concept was transferred from StockCalc. Another feature of this program is where the stock and price to sell at is specified. The program keeps checking the price and when it is greater than or equal to the specified sell price, it stops and shows that price. Currently that functionality does not work.

	<a href="https://github.com/jpwall/personalSite"><div id="projectTitleBlue">This Website</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  Well, obviously this project is the website you are looking at right now! I am constantly changing a multitude of things on it such as the colors, functionality, and look just to name a few. This will be an ongoing project for a long time.
	</p>
	
	<div id="projectTitleGreen">Stockapp.js</div>
	<p id="mainText">
	  This was another stock-oriented program that I made shortly after StockCalc. The main intention of this program though was to return the current price of a stock given the ticker symbol. This worked well but has since been replaced by stock, which is listed above. Most of the code from Stockapp.js was simply copied and pasted into Stock, though.
	</p>
	
	<div id="projectTitleGreen">StockCalc</div>
	<p id="mainText">
	  This was a program that I created to calculate the profits from a stock given the buy price, sell price, number of shares, and fee. This was a rather simple program written in C++ and was mostly a small program to help me in doing the calculations because it was annoying to do them every single time. This has since been replaced with stock. It has all the same functionality and more!

	<a href="https://github.com/jpwall/DesignTechProject" ><div id="projectTitleGreen">Design and Tech Project</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  In the winter of 2014-15 I took a class at my school called Design and Tech. In this class we were tasked with creating an ‘app’ in html and css. We went through how to sketch out designs and file down our ideas of an app into something concrete. Eventually we finished with an app design that we would show to the class during the final block of class. I did about 30% of the entire project the weekend before it was due. Then, as practice on how to use git and GitHub I decided to make a repository for it and put it online both for the practice and personal satisfaction. You can mess around with it ‘here’.

	<div id="projectTitleGreen">Desktop</div>
	<p id="mainText">
	  In the winter of 2011 when I was in 6th grade, I really wanted to build a desktop. At the time I was planning on primarily using it for gaming but that changed relatively quickly. After a year or two of getting some use out of it with games, I got interested in linux and bought a seperate hard drive to put ubuntu on and test out. This sparked a trend of me using one linux distribution for a year or two then switching to another. I have so far tested out Ubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, Arch Linux, and is currently running Debian testing. In the fall of 2015 I replaced both Arch and Windows with Debian 8 Jessie and quickly updated to testing. Currently I use it to serve this website and as a general use webserver. I do all of my programming on my laptop.
