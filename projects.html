	<a href="https://github.com/jpwall/designTechProject2" style="text-decoration:none"><div id="projectTitleGreen">Design and Tech Project 2</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  This project is a newer version of the one that I created for the previous Design and Tech class. I decided to take this course again since I had fun last time and it was a new set of teachers running the show. This year, instead of creating an 'app' that had a specific purpose, we created websites that catered specifically to a certain business, person, or topic. I selected a site where it was necessary to create a website showcasing someone's architecture drawings. It is possible to view and use the site <a href="https://architecture.jessewalling.com">here</a>.

	<a href="https://github.com/jpwall/egit" style="text-decoration:none"><div id="projectTitleGreen">Egit</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  The intention behind egit is to provide the easiest possible introduction to command-line git as possible. The idea came to me in a software development class when my teacher was teaching the use of git and barely anyone understood how to do anything. As a fun side project, I decided to make this node module for practice on how to create one and troubleshoot the issues between different systems and configurations.

	<a href="https://github.com/jpwall/ohHell" style="text-decoration:none"><div id="projectTitleRed">OhHell</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  This program is currently unfinished and in progress. In the future, the main goal of this program is to be able to play the card game called oh hell. This card game is similar to hearts and is a combination of luck and strategy. More can be read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell">here</a>.

	<div id="projectTitleBlue">Blog</div>
	<p id="mainText">
	  I plan to create a blog where I talk about all the things that go on with my endeavors in technology, design, robotics, and art. This blog is going to be based on a blogging engine that a friend of mine has created called stratic developing. When I do eventually have a blog up there will be a ‘Blog’ button in the header of this site. It is not quite at that point yet though since I am still learning about this new technology that I know nothing at all about.

	<a href="fs/art/portraits/" style="text-decoration:none"><div id="projectTitleBlue">Portraits</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  One of my hobbies outside of computers and such are portraits. I do them when I am feeling artistic late at night or when requested. For me they are quite a fun and calming activity to indulge in. Feel free to request one by going to the contact page and reaching me via one of the contact methods listed there. You can also take a look at all the portraits I have done by clicking on the link to them above.

	<a href="https://github.com/jpwall/stock" style="text-decoration:none"><div id="projectTitleRed">Stock</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  Stock is a stalled project that I am working on which is intended to be a go-to program that does everything stock related. Currently it’s capabilities include calculating the profit of a buy/sell stock trade. This concept was transferred from StockCalc. Another feature of this program is the capability of automatically selling once it reaches a certain price point. The program keeps checking the price and when it is greater than or equal to the specified sell price, it stops and shows that price.
	</p>
	
	<a href="https://github.com/jpwall/personalSite" style="text-decoration:none"><div id="projectTitleBlue">This Website</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  Well, this is the website you are looking at right now! I am constantly changing a multitude of things on it such as the colors, functionality, and look of it. This will be an ongoing project for a long time.
	</p>
	
	<div id="projectTitleGreen">Stockapp.js</div>
	<p id="mainText">
	  This was another stock-oriented program that I made shortly after StockCalc. The main intention of this program though was to return the current price of a stock given the ticker symbol. This worked well but has since been replaced by stock, which is listed above. Most of the code from Stockapp.js was simply copied and pasted into stock.
	</p>
	
	<div id="projectTitleGreen">StockCalc</div>
	<p id="mainText">
	  This was a program that I created to calculate the profits from a stock given the buy price, sell price, number of shares, and fee. This was a rather simple program written in C++ and was mostly a small program to help me in doing the calculations because it was annoying to calculate them by hand every single time. This has since been replaced with stock. It has all the same functionality and more!

	<a href="https://github.com/jpwall/DesignTechProject" style="text-decoration:none"><div id="projectTitleGreen">Design and Tech Project</div></a>
	<p id="mainText">
	  In the winter of 2014-15 I took a class at my school called Design and Tech. In this class we were tasked with creating an ‘app’ in html and css. We went over how to sketch out designs and file down our ideas of an app into something concrete. Eventually we finished with an app design that we showed to the class during the final block. I did about 30% of the entire project the weekend before it was due. Afterwards, as practice on how to use git and GitHub, I decided to make a repository for the practice and personal satisfaction. You can mess around with it <a href="http://jpwall.github.io/DesignTechProject">here</a>.

	<div id="projectTitleGreen">Desktop</div>
	<p id="mainText">
	  In the winter of 2011 when I was in 6th grade, I really wanted to build a desktop. At the time I was planning on primarily using it for gaming but that changed relatively quickly. After a year or two of getting some use out of it with games, I got interested in GNU/Linux and bought a seperate hard drive to put Ubuntu on and test out. This sparked a trend of me using one Linux distribution for a year or so then switching to another. I have so far tested out Ubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, Arch Linux, Debian testing and is currently running Debian stable. In the fall of 2015 I replaced both Arch and Windows with Debian 8 Jessie and quickly updated to testing. Shortly afterwards I reinstalled Debian stable to serve this website and to use as a web server.
