	  Hi, I am Jesse Walling and this is my personal website. To get an idea of who I am and what my interests are, you can go to the projects page. This includes in-progress, stalled, completed, and planned for the future. Finally, I have a contact page which includes the best methods to reach me. Make yourself at home and take a look around if you are interested and leave (or not) if you arenâ€™t!

        <div id="titleText">Who are you?</div>
        <p id="mainText">
	  Well, my full name is Jesse Philip Walling, and I am currently a junior in high school (16 years old) attending Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences, more commonly known as SAAS. I am passionate about computers, design, and art. At my school I participate in the robotics program where a large majority of my interests meld together in one place. This is one of my favorite activities to participate in due to the focus on design and programming. I also use GNU/Linux daily and only use Windows when absolutely necessary. Other than that, I would rather not participate in proprietary software projects. Take a look at my projects page if you want to learn more about my (light) programming endeavors. Finally, I enjoy creating art as well. Along with taking an art class at school, I do portrait drawing at home. You can take a look at all of them by going to my projects page.

        <div id="titleText">Why did you make this site?</div>
        <p id="mainText">
	  I created this site because it would be a fun thing to do. I also intended to gain further experience in web design, and the skill of managing a webserver. Additionally, I created this site to provide information about myself to colleagues, future employers, and anyone else that is interested.
