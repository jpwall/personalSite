        <p id="mainText">
	  This site is the personal website of Jesse Philip Walling. It is intended for you to get a grasp on who this individual is and what their passions, thoughts, and ideas are. To get started with that, you can go to my projects page where there is a list of all my projects. This includes in progress, stalled, completed, and planned for the future. Next, you can see that I have a contact page where my preferred contact methods are listed. Make yourself at home and take a look around if you are interested and leave (or not) if you arenâ€™t!

        <div id="titleText">Who am I?</div>
        <p id="mainText">
	  As stated earlier, my name is Jesse Philip Walling and I am a high school student living in Seattle, Washington. I am currently a sophomore attending Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences, more commonly known as SAAS. Some of my burning passions include design, computers in general, and art. At my school I participate in the robotics program where a large amount of design, prototyping, problem solving, and programming all occur at once. This is one of my favorite things to do because it perfectly aligns with my interests in design and computers. As for the computers in general that I mentioned, I use linux daily and only use windows when it is absolutely necessary. Other than that, I would rather not participate in an oversized business earning money off of people just so that they can use a computer. Take a look at my projects page if you want to learn more about my (light) programming endeavors so far in my life. Finally, I enjoy doing art as well. Along with taking art class by choice at school, I do some portrait drawing at home. You can take a look at all of them by going to my projects page.

        <div id="titleText">Why did I make this site?</div>
        <p id="mainText">
	  I made this site for mainly 2 reasons; fun and information. I thought this would be a fun thing to do both because of the experience and managing a server (when I get one built to host this site). Also, I created this site in order to provide information about myself to colleagues, employers, and anyone that is interested! That is why I have not just focused this site around my programming but also on my interests in design and art.
