	  This site is the personal website of Jesse Philip Walling. It is intended for you to get a grasp on who I am and what my passions, thoughts, and ideas are. To get started with that, you can go to my projects page where there is a list of all my projects. This includes in progress, stalled, completed, and planned for the future. Next, you can see that I have a contact page where my preferred contact methods are listed. Make yourself at home and take a look around if you are interested and leave (or not) if you arenâ€™t!

        <div id="titleText">Who am I?</div>
        <p id="mainText">
	  As stated earlier, my name is Jesse Philip Walling and I am a high school student living in Seattle, Washington. I am currently a sophomore (16 years old) attending Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences, more commonly known as SAAS. Some of my burning passions include design, computers, and art. At my school I participate in the robotics program where a large amount of design, prototyping, problem solving, and programming occur at once. This is one of my favorite things to do because it perfectly aligns with my interests in design and computers. I use linux daily and only use Windows when it is absolutely necessary. Other than that, I would rather not participate in proprietary software projects. Take a look at my projects page if you want to learn more about my (light) programming endeavors. Finally, I enjoy doing art as well. Along with taking art class by choice at school, I do some portrait drawing at home. You can take a look at all of them by going to my projects page.

        <div id="titleText">Why did I make this site?</div>
        <p id="mainText">
	  I created this site for mainly 2 reasons; fun and information. I thought this would be a fun thing to do both because of the experience of building a website and managing my own server. Also, I created this site in order to provide information about myself to colleagues, employers, and anyone that is interested. That is why this site is not just focused around my programming but also on my interests in design and art.
